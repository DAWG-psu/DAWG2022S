## Preliminary data analysis results 
2022-07-01

### Research Questions 

1. Differences in the microorganisms present in inflorescences vs pseudoflowers 
2. Same or different microorganisms on the inflorescences of Xyris surinamensis collected on different dates?
3. Same or different microorganisms on the inflorescences of different Xyris species 
4. What other Fusarium are present on inflorescences and pseudoflowers?

### Chapter 1. Differences in the microorganisms present in inflorescences vs pseudoflowers

Figure. **(A)** Alpha diversity measurement (Observed, Shannon index, and InvSimpson index) between Inflorescence and Pseudoflower. Wilcox test were used to calculate statistical sigfinicance (p-value). **(B)** PCA ordination plot based on Euclidean distance of CLR transformed sample count. 

#### 2. Fungal community
