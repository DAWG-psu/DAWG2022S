## Preliminary data analysis results 
2022-07-01

### Research Questions 

1. Differences in the microorganisms present in inflorescences vs pseudoflowers 
2. Same or different microorganisms on the inflorescences of Xyris surinamensis collected on different dates?
3. Same or different microorganisms on the inflorescences of different Xyris species?

### Chapter 1. Differences in the microorganisms present in inflorescences vs pseudoflowers 

#### 1. Bacterial community

Figure. **(A)** Alpha diversity measurement (Observed, Shannon index, and InvSimpson index) between Inflorescence and Pseudoflower. Wilcox test were used to calculate statistical sigfinicance (p-value). **(B)** PCA ordination plot based on Euclidean distance of CLR transformed family count.

### Chapter 3. Same or different microorganisms on the inflorescences of different Xyris species

Hmmm... we can see the clear differences in samples from Xyris_surinamensis, let's divide samples with more categories

![stacked_bar_16s_family_overall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62360632/177226508-bbcf0296-ef79-4ff0-a057-3dab787b374d.png)

Okay, now we can see more clear distinct between samples. Let's do the same thing for fungal community

Okay, I think this plot is a good starting point for us for further analysis. 
Based on the last two plot, I think it might not be useful for alpha and beta diversity only compare two groups (e.g., inflorescences vs pseudoflowers) becuase it has multiple factors associated with microbiome composition.
